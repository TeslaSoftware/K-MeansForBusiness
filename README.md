# K-MeansForBusiness
K-means algorithm for business evaluation
This is final project for Computer Science Course in Artifical Inteligence (CS363) in Queens College.
This program uses publically available data from Census to get the population in different age groups per zip-code.
Then program maps zip codes to geo-location coordinates and uses this data to perform K-means algorithm.
The program returns centroids and also their statistical evaluation (IV /EV). 
This is practical application of machine learning which would allow expanding business to decide where to place new branches of stores in different location knowing which age group they are willing to target.
